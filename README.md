# EDA Project  - AIPM course

Welcome to the EDA project of week 5 in the AIPM course.

## Short description of the problem
1.	Through EDA/statistical analysis I will present at least 3 insights regarding the overall data, one of them  geographical.
2. I will present at least 3 recommendations for my client Erin Robinson. She invests in poor neighborhoods, does buying & selling, wants mainly to have her costs back and make a little profit. She is a socially responsible woman. 
3. Recommendations will include
* where to best invest for making a profit (geographically) (even if small).
* advice for doing renovations and when to do them 
* emerging areas - still quite cheap but with growing interest
* what time of the year is best to buy and sell, directed at her area of interest (poor neighborhoods)
4. Assumptions and information from Erin to better specify her search : 
* "poor" areas means that it is within the 20% cheapest houses in the county
* average house condition in area is quite low (average grade is <= 4)
* house has not been renovated in last 30 years. 
* overall grade of the unit and condition of house is above average
* price is relatively cheap
* plot size is relatively big
5. Hypothesis
* There are poor areas that are growing faster than others, making them more interesting
* Within poor areas, the houses with bigger plots are not much more expensive than the ones with smaller plots (therefor look
for bigger plots)
* When doing renovations, prices increase to make a nice but measured profit 

## Description of the contents of the repository 
* <b>EDA.jpynb</b> contains the Jupyter Notebook with the code I've written for this project and comments explaining it. 

* README.md this file that describes the contents of the repository. This file is the source of information for navigating through the repository.

* <b>EDA_Project_insights.pdf</b> (and EDA_Project_insights.ppt) is a short presentation giving a high-level overview of my methodology and recommendations for my client Erin. 

* cleanup.py - a Python script for processing and cleaning my data, using functions and docstrings.
